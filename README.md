1] This repository is a collection of React projects that I have created for learning and practice purposes.

2] Each project includes its own README file with information on how to run and use the application.

3] The projects range in complexity from beginner-level applications to more advanced projects that incorporate multiple components and libraries.

4] By sharing my code in this repository, I hope to contribute to the React community and inspire other developers to create their own projects.

5] Feel free to fork this repository, modify the projects, and submit pull requests if you have ideas for improvements or new features.

👉 Project 2: React Modern CV Website

✅ ModernCV is a React-based website that showcases your resume or curriculum vitae (CV) in a modern and visually appealing way.

✅ The website utilizes several popular dependencies, including "@iconscout/react-unicons," "framer-motion," "react-router-dom," "react-type-animation," "react-water-wave," "styled-components," and "swiper."

✅ React hooks are used to make the website more dynamic, such as "useState" to update component state and "useEffect" to perform side effects in response to changes in state or props.

✅ The website features a range of interactive and animated components, such as a water wave animation in the background and a typewriter-style text animation for the job titles.

✅ ModernCV also features a responsive design, allowing the website to adapt to different screen sizes and provide an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

👉 Project 3: KBC Quiz Website

✅ Comprehensive KBC Features: Describe the range of features your KBC quiz website offers. Highlight that it includes all essential functionalities such as multiple-choice questions, lifelines (e.g., 50-50, audience poll), difficulty levels, timers, and a scoring system. Emphasize that your project covers the complete KBC experience.

✅ Effective Sound Effects: Mention how you have incorporated suitable sound effects to enhance the user experience. Explain that the sound effects are carefully selected to match the KBC theme and add excitement to the quiz. For example, you can mention the sound of a ticking clock or the iconic "ding" for correct answers.

✅ Utilization of Context Hook: Discuss how you leveraged the Context Hook in React.js to manage state and provide a seamless flow of data across components. Explain the benefits of using the Context Hook, such as avoiding prop drilling and making it easier to share data between components.
