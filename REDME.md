1] This repository is a collection of React projects that I have created for learning and practice purposes.

2] Each project includes its own README file with information on how to run and use the application.

3] The projects range in complexity from beginner-level applications to more advanced projects that incorporate multiple components and libraries.

4] By sharing my code in this repository, I hope to contribute to the React community and inspire other developers to create their own projects.

5] Feel free to fork this repository, modify the projects, and submit pull requests if you have ideas for improvements or new features.

👉 Project 2: React Modern CV Website

✅ ModernCV is a React-based website that showcases your resume or curriculum vitae (CV) in a modern and visually appealing way.

✅ The website utilizes several popular dependencies, including "@iconscout/react-unicons," "framer-motion," "react-router-dom," "react-type-animation," "react-water-wave," "styled-components," and "swiper."

✅ React hooks are used to make the website more dynamic, such as "useState" to update component state and "useEffect" to perform side effects in response to changes in state or props.

✅ ModernCV also features a responsive design, allowing the website to adapt to different screen sizes and provide an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
